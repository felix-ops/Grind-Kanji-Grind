## Introduction

Learning a subject is most effective when actively engaged in it. Similarly, this tool facilitates rapid memorization of Kanji and its corresponding meaning through a quiz-based learning approach. While the traditional flashcard method is useful for solidifying concepts over the long term, Grind Kanji Grind excels at swiftly comprehending Kanji characters. Utilizing a quiz format, users receive instant feedback on each mistake and correct choice, enhancing the efficiency of the learning process.

## Prerequisites

If you have a windows machine you can directly run the .exe file to run the app

The prerequisites required for running the python file

- Python 3.12.1
- Pillow 8.0.1
- tk 0.1.0
- ttkthemes 3.0.0

## Usage

This application encompasses a comprehensive collection of 1,973 Kanji characters, organized according to the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) levels. Users can easily select Kanji based on their respective JLPT levels. By default, the app allows users to click on any Kanji to view its meaning. When the 'Play' button is activated alongside the timer, the app seamlessly transitions into quiz mode. During the quiz, users can click on Kanji buttons to progress through the questions.
The button "shuffle upto current level" checkbox will randomly select kanji before the currently selected level and make a quiz from that.

It is advisable not to use the shuffle button until one becomes thoroughly familiar with the current Kanji level, as it may disrupt the learning flow.

## Additional Notes

I've developed this tool for personal use, and witnessing its effectiveness has led me to share it with others. While there may be some UI-related issues, the overall functionality of the tool is quite useful. I encourage anyone interested in creating their own enhanced version of this app. I would love to see different implementations, and I welcome contributions to improve this tool. Feel free to raise pull requests, and I assure you that I will review them. Thank you for your interest and potential contributions.
