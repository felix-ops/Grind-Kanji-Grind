## Introduction

Learning a subject is most effective when actively engaged in it. Similarly, this tool facilitates rapid memorization of Kanji and its corresponding meaning through a quiz-based learning approach. While the traditional flashcard method is useful for solidifying concepts over the long term, Grind Kanji Grind excels at swiftly comprehending Kanji characters. Utilizing a quiz format, users receive instant feedback on each mistake and correct choice, enhancing the efficiency of the learning process.

## Prerequisites

If you have a windows machine you can directly run the .exe file to run the app

The prerequisites required for running the python file

- Python 3.12.1
- Pillow 8.0.1
- tk 0.1.0
- ttkthemes 3.0.0

## Usage
 
This application encompasses a comprehensive collection of 1,973 Kanji characters, organized according to the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) levels. Users can easily select Kanji based on their respective JLPT levels. By default, the app allows users to click on any Kanji to view its meaning. When the 'Play' button is activated alongside the timer, the app seamlessly transitions into quiz mode. During the quiz, users can click on Kanji buttons to progress through the questions.
The button "shuffle upto current level" checkbox will randomly select kanji before the currently selected level and make a quiz from that.

It is advisable not to use the shuffle button until one becomes thoroughly familiar with the current Kanji level, as it may disrupt the learning flow.

With Grind Kanji Grind we can easily memorize around 80 - 100 new kanji in the 1st hour itself.  And here's how to do it, 

First we have to select the JLPT level and a set of kanji within that level. The maximum time limit for each quiz session is 15 minutes, but before starting the quiz we should revise all the kanji and it's meaning for the currently selected level, try to remember as much as possible and it's ok to not remember all the kanji when you feel confident start the quiz and try to guess all the kanji corresponding to it's meaning, at first attempt you'll make a lot of mistakes and you might not be able to complete the quiz within time and it's totally ok.  Then revise the same Kanji set, but this time it'll be easier since you've got a lot of positive and negative feedback from the first quiz you'll naturally focus more over the kanji you've found difficult.  And then retry the same quiz after the 2nd study session,  it'll be much easier this time. And by the 3rd time attempting the quiz you'll remember almost all the kanji for that level.  When you are comfortable move on to the next set of kanji characters.

## Additional Notes

I've developed this tool for personal use, and after witnessing its effectiveness has led me to share it with others. While there might be some UI-related issues, but the overall functionality of the tool is quite useful. Also I encourage anyone interested in creating their own enhanced version of this app. I would love to see different implementations, and I welcome contributions to improve this tool. Feel free to raise pull requests, and I assure you that I will review them. Thank you for your interest and potential contributions.
